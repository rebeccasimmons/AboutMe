# About Me


Hello everyone!

I am currently a graduate student at Columbus State University. I am studying Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security. I love learning new programming languages. I know how to program in five languages which include Python, Java, JavaScript, and Visual Basic. Right now, I am learning on my own is C++. 

This account has some of my projects that I have done in my undergraduate program of Information Technology. The projects that are shown are in C, Python, HTML, and Visual Basic .NET.
